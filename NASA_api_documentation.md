# Get Started with NASAâ€™s API

## Overview
NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_Picture_of_the_Day) (APOD) provides a different image of our universe each day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. This documentation guides developers through the process of obtaining an API key, making requests to the APOD API, and handling the JSON response to get the media content.

## Prerequisites
To get started with the APOD API, make sure you have:
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML
- A code editor (e.g,. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API testing tool

## Obtaining an API Key
To access NASA's APIs:
1. Navigate to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)
2. Fill out the registration form with your first name, last name, and email address.
3. Submit the form to receive an email with your unique API key.
> NOTE: NASA's demo API key is limited to 30 requests per IP address per hour or 50 requests per IP address per day. For increased limits, register for a free API key.
