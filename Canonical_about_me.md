# üìò Documentation Experience and Insight

- **Outline your experience working on software documentation**  
  (Think about: its type, audience, complexity, industry context, how you made a difference to it).
  Feel free to include a link to any publicly-visible work that you‚Äôd like to share with us.

One of the software documentation projects I worked on was a guide titled ["Install and Configure Node.js + npm on Ubuntu"](#install-and-configure-nodejs--npm-on-ubuntu-2004-step-by-step-guide). Although it was a personal project, I approached it with professional writing processes in mind. I outlined the goal and structure beforehand, wrote iteratively using Markdown, and tested all terminal commands on a fresh Ubuntu installation to ensure technical accuracy.

What worked well was how I prioritized clarity ‚Äî I wrote each step assuming the reader might be new to Linux, explained why each command was used, and approached it the way I would explain a complex grammar topic to a student. I also received informal reviews from experienced technical writers, which helped me improve tone and conciseness.

I‚Äôd like to add a more formal documentation review pipeline ‚Äî using GitHub Issues, pull requests, and checklists to better simulate a team workflow. I‚Äôd also include versioning notes to account for OS updates and possibly add testing steps for post-installation validation. In the future, I plan to include visual aids and accessibility checks to further improve the user experience.



- **What is the most significant body of documentation that you have had responsibility for?**

When I lived in Da Nang, Vietnam, I used to work at school, called 'Language Bridge'. I worked there from 2018 to 2021. Over time, the school expanded and grew from one center to three. They needed to hire more teachers, and many of those were foreign teachers. The school administration asked me to write and present a code of conduct to a group of new teachers. The code of conduct included some aspects, as:
- Lesson planning
- Arrival time
- Vacation leave
- Uniform
- Critical situations
- Communication with parents
etc.

I created both a document and a visual presentation.

- **What is your proudest success or accomplishment as a technical author?**

I haven't had any experience in technical writing yet, but I have strong fundamental skills to start, such as teaching skills (which help me to simplify complex concepts), software development knowledge with some practice and experience living in different countries, such as China, Vietnam, Ukraine, USA and Canada.

- **What open-source software documentation do you use the most?**  
  How would you suggest improving its content?

After receiving the written interview questions from Holly Hall last Sunday, this particular question stood out to me ‚Äî and it actually motivated me to start contributing. While both pull requests are still awaiting approval, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve submitted so far:

1) [TLDR Pages ‚Äì Added a new section titled ‚ÄúVI. Periodic Maintenance Tasks‚Äù to the Maintainer‚Äôs Guide](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/16628)

I found an open issue in their repository that mentioned a lack of visibility into long-term maintainer responsibilities. I contributed a new section that outlines recurring tasks like reviewing staleness, link health, and automation checks.

2) [Scikit-learn ‚Äì Added contextual links to improve code clarity in the SVM ANOVA example](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31451)

In this contribution, I added references to the official Scikit-learn documentation in the [plot_svm_anova.py](plot_svm_anova.py) example. This helps users more easily understand how the code relates to core SVM and ANOVA features, especially if they‚Äôre not yet familiar with those concepts.

These contributions taught me that it‚Äôs more effective to focus on a small number of open-source projects. When you take the time to learn their style, structure, and workflows, you can spot issues more easily ‚Äî and your contributions tend to align better with community expectations.

- **Consider one of the software documentation projects you have worked on.**
  How well did its processes work, and what would you like to improve?

My experience with software documentation has grown through a series of technical writing projects I‚Äôve created independently and refined with help from experienced reviewers. I specialize in writing tutorials and API documentation for developers, especially those who are early in their learning journey or transitioning to new technologies.

For example, in my guide ‚ÄúInstall and Configure Node & npm on Ubuntu,‚Äù I wrote for developers setting up their environment on Linux. The complexity was moderate ‚Äî it involved shell commands, repository setup, and system permissions. I made a difference by explaining why each command mattered and tailoring the tone for non-experts. The guide lives on GitHub and has been reviewed by others in the tech writing space:

["Install and Configure Node.js + npm on Ubuntu"](#install-and-configure-nodejs--npm-on-ubuntu-2004-step-by-step-guide)

Another project, ‚ÄúNASA API Documentation,‚Äù is a more technical reference and tutorial hybrid for the Astronomy Picture of the Day API. The audience is developers building apps or educational tools using the API. The project involved documenting endpoints, authentication, and usage examples, with a focus on clarity and usefulness.

[Get Started with NASA‚Äôs API](#get-started-with-nasas-api)

Though these were not full-time roles, I treated both projects like professional deliverables ‚Äî outlining purpose, identifying target users, testing content, and incorporating feedback. I use Markdown, Git, and VS Code regularly, and I‚Äôm excited to bring this skillset into a collaborative, open-source-focused environment like Canonical‚Äôs.

# **Install and Configure Node.js + npm on Ubuntu 20.04: Step-by-step guide**
## **Introduction**

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about) is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on server-side. [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) (Node Package Manager) is a default package manager for Node.js.
By the end of this tutorial, you will have Node.js and npm installed using three different methods ‚Äî whether you want the latest version, multiple versions, or long-term support (LTS) versions.
## **Prerequisites**
Before installing anything, make sure your system is up to date. Run this command directly in your Ubuntu terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
This ensures your system has the latest version of packages.

## **Option 1 ‚Äì Install via APT from Ubuntu Repositories (Beginner-Friendly)**
This is the most popular way to get the latest version of Node.js and npm.

### **Step 1 - Install Node.js and npm**
```bash
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

### **Step 2 - Verify installation**
Check that Node.js is installed:
```bash
node -v
```
You will likely get Node.js 16.z.z or 18.w.w

For npm, run:
```bash
npm -v
```
You will get npm 8.z.z to 10.w.w

![check_node_npm_installed](media/check_node_npm_installed.png)

>If npm fails to install, run `sudo apt install npm`

You have successfully installed **Node.js** and **npm** using the apt method.

---

## **Option 2 - Install Using Node Version Manager (NVM)**
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#about) allows you to install and switch between different versions of Node.js. Initially, you will get the latest versions for both Node.js and npm.

> **Why use NVM?**  
> NVM is the preferred tool for developers because it allows you to switch between Node.js versions without affecting your system-wide (global) Node installation.  
> This is especially useful when working on multiple projects that require different versions of Node.

### **Step 1 - Install NVM**
Run the following command:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```
In your terminal, you'll see a message like this:
```bash
=> => Compressing and cleaning up git repository

=> nvm source string already in /home/labber/.bashrc
=> bash_completion source string already in /home/labber/.bashrc
=> Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

### **Restart your terminal or run:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

> **Warning:** This command downloads and runs a script from the internet. Only use official sources like the [NVM GitHub](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). You can inspect the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh) before running it.

### **Step 2 - Install Node.js with NVM:**
Install the latest [Long Term Support](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.9.0) (LTS) version of Node.js:
```bash
nvm install --lts
```
```bash
nvm use --lts
```

### **Step 3 - Choose any other Node.js version**

To view the list of available versions, run:

```bash
nvm list-remote
```
Example output
```bash
        v22.4.1
        v22.5.0
        v22.5.1
        v22.6.0
        v22.7.0
        v22.8.0
        v22.9.0
        v22.10.0
        v22.11.0   (LTS: Jod)
        v22.12.0   (LTS: Jod)
        v22.13.0   (LTS: Jod)
        v22.13.1   (LTS: Jod)
->      v22.14.0   (Latest LTS: Jod)
        v23.0.0
        v23.1.0
        v23.2.0
        v23.3.0
        v23.4.0
```
Choose the version and install it:
```bash
nvm install v18.20.0
```
View the list of your installed Node.js versions:
```bash
nvm list
```
```bash
       v18.20.0
->     v19.9.0
       v22.14.0
default -> lts/* (-> v22.14.0)
iojs -> N/A (default)
unstable -> N/A (default)
node -> stable (-> v22.14.0) (default)
stable -> 22.14 (-> v22.14.0) (default)
```
The current version is marked with an arrow sign **->**, occasionally followed by some name aliases.

There are different aliases for the [long-term support releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases):
```bash
lts/* -> lts/hydrogen (-> N/A)
lts/argon -> v4.9.1 (-> N/A)
lts/boron -> v6.17.1 (-> N/A)
lts/carbon -> v8.17.0 (-> N/A)
lts/dubnium -> v10.24.1 (-> N/A)
lts/erbium -> v12.22.12 (-> N/A)
lts/fermium -> v14.21.2
lts/gallium -> v16.19.0 (-> N/A)
lts/hydrogen -> v18.13.0 (-> N/A)
```
You can install Node.js versions based on aliases as well. For example, to install the latest long-term support version, **Jod**, run this command:

```bash
nvm install lts/jod
```
```bash
Downloading and installing node v22.14.0...
. . .
Now using node v22.14.0 (npm v10.9.2)
```
You can switch any other version, using ```nvm use```:
```bash
nvm use v18.20.0
```
```bash
Now using node v18.20.0 (npm v10.5.0)
```
## **Option 3 - Install Using [NodeSource PPA](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md)**
If you need a different version of Node.js, use a PPA (personal package archive) developed by NodeSource. PPAs have more available versions than default Ubuntu repositories. Node.js v20.x is available as of April 2025

### **Step 1 - Choose your version**
Decide what version you want. For example, if you want Node.js 18.x, you'll use `setup_18.x`.

### **Step 2 - Download the setup script**
Run the following command to download the setup script:
```bash
cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
```
### **Step 3 - (Optional) Check the script**
Check the contents of the script before running it.

```bash
nano nodesource_setup.sh
```
You will see:
```bash
Logger Function
log() {
  local message="$1"
  local type="$2"
  local timestamp=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
  local color
  local endcolor="\033[0m"

  case "$type" in
    "info") color="\033[38;5;79m" ;;
    "success") color="\033[1;32m" ;;
    "error") color="\033[1;31m" ;;
    *) color="\033[1;34m" ;;
  esac
```
Press Ctrl + X to exit.

### **Step 4 - Run the setup script**
Execute the setup script:
```bash
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
```
### **Step 5 - Install Node.js + npm**
Next, install Node.js:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```
### **Step 6 - Verify installation**
Check that Node.js and npm are installed:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
Output:
```bash
v18.x.x
```
#### **Success!**
You have successfully installed Node.js and npm. Try building your first CLI app, install a popular framework like Express.js, or explore npm packages to extend your project.

## **Visual Summary - Node.js Installation Methods**

The diagram below provides a quick overview of the three different ways to install Node.js and npm on Ubuntu:

![node_npm_ubuntu](media/node_npm_ubuntu.png)

## **Which method should I Use?**

| Method             | Best for...                                 | Notes                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Apt (Option 1)** | Beginners, simple installs                  | May not have the latest version        |
| **NVM (Option 2)** | Developers who need multiple Node versions  | Lightweight and flexible               |
| **NodeSource (Opt 3)** | Specific versions without using NVM     | Good for controlled version installs   |

> Only use **one installation method** at a time. If you mix `apt`, `nvm`, and `nodesource`, you might run into version conflicts.
- To remove previous installs:
```bash
  sudo apt remove nodejs npm
```

# Get Started with NASA‚Äôs API

## Overview

NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_Picture_of_the_Day) (APOD) shares a new space-related image every day, each accompanied by a short explanation from a NASA astronomer. This documentation guides developers through the process of obtaining an API Key, making requests to the APOD API, and handling the JSON response to get the media content.

## Table of Contents
1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
3. [Obtaining an API Key](#obtaining-an-api-key)
4. [Making API Requests](#making-api-requests)
5. [Handling API Responses](#handling-api-responses)
6. [Optional URL Parameters](#optional-url-parameters)
7. [Code Examples](#code-examples)
8. [Use Cases](#use-cases)
9. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
10. [Reference](#reference)

## Prerequisites

To get started with the APOD API, make sure you have:
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) API testing tool

## Obtaining an API Key

To access NASA's APIs:
1. Navigate to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)
2. Fill out the registration form with your first name, last name, and email address.
3. Submit the form to receive an email with your unique API Key.
> üí°NOTE: NASA's demo API Key is limited to 30 requests per IP address per hour or 50 requests per IP address per day. For increased limits, register for a free API Key.

## Making API Requests

The basic APOD API endpoint:
```bash
https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=${YOUR_API_KEY}
```
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key (or use `DEMO_KEY` for limited testing).

### JavaScript (Fetch API):

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const url = `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=${apiKey}`;

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
  console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching APOD:', error);
  });
```
This snippet uses the **Fetch API** to send a GET request and log the JSON response to the console.

### Test with Postman
To manually test the API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), follow these steps:
1. Open Postman and start a new tab
2. Select the `GET` type request.
3. Paste your request URL:
```bash
https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```
4. Click **Send**
5. Receive the JSON response

## Handling API Responses

When **successful**, the APOD API returns a JSON object that includes the image or video of the day, its metadata, and a written description.

## Code Examples

Before diving into the code, here‚Äôs a quick visual preview of what you can build with the APOD API.

> üí°NOTE: This simple HTML page dynamically fetches and displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day using JavaScript.

### Visual Demo

<!-- START_APOD -->
**Curly Spiral Galaxy M63**  
**2025-05-22**

A bright spiral galaxy of the northern sky, Messier 63 is nearby, about 30 million light-years distant toward the loyal constellation Canes Venatici. Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across‚Äîabout the size of our own Milky Way. Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, *The Sunflower Galaxy*. This exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint loops and curling star streams far into the galaxy's halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63. Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in the remarkable wide-field image, including dwarf galaxies, which could contribute to M63's star streams in the next few billion years.

        container.innerHTML = `
          <h2>${data.title}</h2>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> ${data.date}</p>
          <img src="${data.url}" alt="${data.title}" width="600">
          <p>${data.explanation}</p>
        `;
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching APOD:', error);
      });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Python Example: Backend Script

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Replace with your API key
url = f"https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key={API_KEY}"

response = requests.get(url)  # Send the GET request to NASA's APOD API

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Title:", data["title"])
    print("Date:", data["date"])
    print("URL:", data["url"])
    print("Explanation:", data["explanation"])
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data. Status code:", response.status_code)
```

## Use Cases

NASA's APOD API can be used in a variety of projects. Here are some ideas:
1. Daily Image Website
Build a personal or public site that displays the Astronomy Picture of the Day. Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript to fetch and update the content daily via the API.

2. Desktop Widget or Wallpaper Rotator
Use the API to fetch a new image each day and set it as your desktop wallpaper (using Python with pywallpaper or platform-specific tools).

3. Mobile App
Integrate APOD into a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter, displaying daily space content in a beautiful layout.

4. Classroom/Education Tool
Use it to introduce astronomy in educational settings. Create an interactive gallery or timeline with daily images, explanations, and media types.

5. AI/ML Projects
Use the image metadata and explanations to build a dataset for natural language processing, concept extraction, or image classification.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the APOD API, here are some common problems and their solutions:

**API Key Errors:**
- Problem: ‚ÄúAPI_KEY_INVALID‚Äù or similar message
- Solution: Double-check you copied your API Key correctly and didn‚Äôt accidentally include spaces or quotes.

<br>

**Rate Limit Exceeded**
- Problem: You hit the demo key‚Äôs rate limit.
- Solution: Register for a free API Key to unlock more requests (30 requests per hour with a demo key vs. higher limits with a registered key).

<br>

**Invalid Date Format**
- Problem: `date` parameter returns an error.
- Solution: Make sure the format is `YYYY-MM-DD`. Avoid dates before June 1995, when APOD started.

<br>

**Empty or Incomplete Response**
- Problem: The JSON response is missing fields like `hdurl`.
- Solution: Not all images have HD versions. Check `media_type` and use fallbacks where needed.

<br>

**Video Handling**
- Problem: Trying to display a video as an image.
- Solution: If `media_type` is `"video"`, use an `<iframe>` instead of `<img>`, or request the `thumbnail_url` with `thumbs=true`.

**Example:** Handling Media Types in JS
```javascript
if (data.media_type === "image") {
  document.body.innerHTML += `<img src="${data.url}" width="600">`;
} else if (data.media_type === "video") {
  document.body.innerHTML += `<iframe width="600" src="${data.url}" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`;
}
```
