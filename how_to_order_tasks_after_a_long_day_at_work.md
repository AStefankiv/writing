Evening Productivity: How to Prioritize Tasks After a Long Workday

Lead into the post with a short 100-200 word introduction. Be sure to highlight:

*The reason why what you’re talking about is important.*
*Who, what industry, or what sector of the industry this applies to.*
*What you’ll be covering [i.e. “in this post, we’ll explain why (term) is *important, explain how to (term), and provide 8 suggestions if you’re new to (term)”].*
*What is [Term], and Why Does it Matter?*
*Some readers may have no idea what it is you’re explaining how to do. Obviously, if what you’re writing about is well-known, you can skip the definition.*
*After defining the term, explain why it’s important for the reader to understand the idea and/or know how to do what you’re writing about.*

"Stress doesn't come from hard work. Stress primarily comes from not taking action over something that you can have some control over."–Jeff Bezos


You finish your workday and it’s finally time to go home. After a long day of meetings, tasks, and social interactions, it’s tempting to collapse on the sofa, grab a snack or a drink, and zone out with a game or an episode of a series. That’s fine now and then. Just remember: you have a greater goal that may soon make your dream come true.

If you want to make progress in your career, achieve your personal goals, or keep your day productive, this article is for you.

In this post, we’ll show you how to plan your after-work time effectively: what to start with and which tasks to do last, how to boost energy, improve focus, and eliminate distractions.


How to [Task] 
This section should make up the bulk of the writing in your blog post. It’s enormously important for each step to have its own section header for optimal organization, clarity for the reader, and search engine optimization. Additionally, breaking instructions up by sections also lets you include visual aids for each step as needed in the form of a GIF, image, or video. 
It’s important to remember to be clear, concise, and accurate in the steps you provide your readers. Any extra “fluff” to the article may confuse them, resulting in some readers not achieving the results they intended. 

If what you’re explaining how to do is solve an equation (i.e. “How to Calculate Break Even”), provide a step-by-step explanation and example of how to calculate the rate, point, or number you’re explaining how to reach. Show all of your work so the reader can follow along easily.

## Goals, Duties, and Recreation

Are you a student, pursuing a better career, or someone with active lifestyle? It's important to define your goals.
Whether you like it or not, but most of us–adults–have daily/weekly duties, like cleaning, cooking meals etc.
And of course, don't forget to have a "me time".

| **Goals**                                 | **Duties**                        | **Recreation**                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Study / Learning                           | Home & Admin (chores, bills, errands) | Recharge (movies, gaming, reading)        |
| Job Search & Networking / Professional Development | Family & Social (family responsibilities, caregiving) | Sports (gym, jogging)                    |
| Physical Well-Being (exercise, meal prep, sleep hygiene) | Appointments (dentist, doctor, bank visits, paperwork) |   Hobby, Socializing, Travel     |


After you defined your goal, let's see how much time you have. There are 24 hours in a day. An average person works 8 hours, sleeps 8 hours, and has 8 hours for other things. We'll take away commuting, phone calls and rest. Let's assume you have around 5 hours on weekdays after work and 12 hours on weekends. In total it's 49 hours, but let's round it up to 50 hours.

Realistically, you can devote for your:
- Goals: 28 hours
- Duties: 12 hours
- Recreation: 10 hours

# Tips and Reminders for [Term] (Optional)
If you’re breaking down a difficult concept or task, some readers may still feel overwhelmed and unsure of their ability to tackle it. Break down a few suggestions on how to best approach the concept, and/or a few reminders about it. This is not a list post, so keep this short list to three to five pieces of advice. 

If you feel the step-by-step approach is sufficient, you can choose not to include this section. 
Closing
Wrap up your amazing new blog post with a great closing. Remind your readers of the key takeaway you want them to walk away with and consider pointing them to other resources you have on your website. 
Call-to-Action
Last but not least, place a call-to-action at the bottom of your blog post. This should be to a lead-generating piece of content or to a sales-focused landing page for a demo or consultation. For example, if your product or service helps your readers do what it is they searched “how to” do, or if you have a template in your content resource library that does what they searched “how to” do, that would be a perfect CTA for this post. 


- Write a to-do-list (start with the easiest tasks to give you the feeling of accomplishment)
- Fix your body posture
- Walk / Jog for the creative output / Gym (melatonin)
- Take a power nap (don't force yourself) dark, quiet, cool
- Reward yourself (snack / soda / no devices)
- Review study materials when low mental focus
- Screen Time tracker/self-control apps.
