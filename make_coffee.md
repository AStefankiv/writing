#### Choose a simple machine that won't overwhelm you with abundance of buttons and modes. Consider the following tips:
- Look for machines with intuitive control and features that simplify the brewing process.
- Consider machines with clear instructions and available online tutorials.
- Look for machines with the stable pump, as they have consistent pressure.
- Choose a machine that's easy to clean. Disassambling your machine will make maintenance less of a chore.

### Find a convenient grinder
#### Choosing the best coffee bean grinder may determine most of your brewing experience. The proper grind significantly affects the coffee taste.
#### `!Note: If your espresso machine already has an inbuild grinder, you may skip this part.`
**A perfect grinder has**:
- **Grind modes:** You always get the same grind size. Generally, fine grinds are preferred for espresso.
- **Serving amount:** Grind the exact amount for a single or double espresso shot.

**Avoid blade grinders for the following reasons:**
- **Too fine/too course:** It's really difficult to make the same ground level each time you brew your coffee.
- **Wrong amount:** Each time you will have to measure the amount of beans manually. It may add some inconvenience to your morning routine.

### Type of bean roast
#### There are four main types of roast levels:
- **Light roast** - These light brown beans have no oil on the surface and are known for their bright acidity and highlighting the coffee's original, often fruity or floral, flavors.
- **Medium roast** - Medium brown in color, these roasts offer a balanced flavor profile, mellowing the acidity while developing more body and sweetness compared to light roasts.
- **Medium-dark roast** - With a richer, darker color and possibly some surface oil, these beans have lower acidity, a heavier body, and feature bittersweet flavors where the roast character becomes more prominent.
- **Dark roast** - Very dark brown to almost black and typically oily, dark roasts have minimal acidity, a heavy body, and bold, smoky, or bittersweet flavors that dominate over the bean's origin characteristics.

### Which one is best for espresso?
Most people typically prefer either **medium-dark roast** or **dark roast**. Their lower acidity, heavier body, and developed roast flavors create a bold, rich shot of espresso.
**Medium roast** is also very popular, offering a balance between origin character and roast notes.

### Oil
#### Adding oil lets caffeine gradually get into blood and gives you longer term energy. Therefore, you won't get spikes of anxiety.
- **MCT oil** - Use MCT oil, a special liquid fat, for fast energy for your body.
- **Coconut oil** - Choose coconut oil, made from coconuts, for its healthy fats and unique taste, just remember it gets solid when cold.
- **Butter** - Add butter, made from milk cream, to give food a rich flavor and creamy feel.

### Adding flavors and sweeteners (optional)
#### There is a great variety of sweeteners around. Choose only those, which are keto-friendly.
- **Monk fruit sweetener** - This natural, zero-calorie sweetener derived from monk fruit provides intense sweetness with no impact on blood sugar, making it highly suitable for keto.
- **Erythritol** - As a sugar alcohol, erythritol offers sweetness with negligible calories and minimal effect on blood glucose levels, commonly used in keto baking and beverages.
- **Allulose** - Allulose is a rare type of sugar with very few calories and almost no impact on blood sugar or insulin, mimicking the taste and texture of sugar effectively for keto dieters.

### The best espresso cup
#### Make sure your cup holds all the ingredients. The standard espresso cup holds 2 to 3 fluid ounces (about 60 to 90 milliliters). It can comfortably hold a single shot (roughly 1 oz / 30 ml) or a double shot (doppio, roughly 2 oz / 60 ml) of espresso.


## Step-by-step guide
### Once you have all the items above, let's start:
1. **Add oil:** Place your desired oil (butter) and sweetener into an espresso cup.
2. **Prepare a cup:** Put the cup on the drip tray.
3. **Measure beans:** Load your coffee bean grinder with coffee beans. Make sure that the amount is 18 to 20 grams (being a very common starting point).
4. **Grind the beans:** Start the grinding machine and wait until grinding is over.
5. **Transfer the grounds into the portafilter basket:** Level the grounds gently by tapping the portafilter or using a distribution tool. Aim for the flat surface.
6. **Tamp the grounds:** Apply firm pressure straight down to compact the coffee grounds into a solid, level puck.
7. **Clean the portafilter:** Wipe away any loose coffee grounds from the rim, ears, and spouts of the portafilter. This ensures a clean lock into the machine and prevents grounds from getting into your cup or disrupting the seal.
8. **Lock-in and position cup:** Place your pre-warmed espresso cup(s) on the drip tray under the portafilter spout(s).
9. **Start brewing:** Start the brewing process on your espresso machine.
10. **Monitor the brewing process:** Watch the espresso flow. It should start as dark drips, then form steady streams, eventually lightening in color.

Your espresso is now brewed and ready for you to enjoy.
