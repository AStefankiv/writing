# How to Contribute to Open Source

## What is Open Source? (Definitions, examples with links, why contribute)

Open source is source code or documentation that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution(source: Wikipedia)—often hosted on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). To make it simple - anyone, who believes in collaboration, transparency and innovation, can contribute to open source projects to make a positive impact.

You've probably used open-source tools without even realizing it! For example:
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox) – an open-source web browser
- [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) – the operating system behind Android and many servers
- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) – a popular code editor

Why should you contribute?
Besides leaving your name in the project forever, contributing to open source is a great way to:
- Build your skills with real-world projects
- Collaborate with developers from around the world
- Strengthen your portfolio and resume
- Learn version control tools like Git in a practical way
- Grow your confidence as a coder and communicator

Whether you're fixing typos, writing documentation, or adding features—every contribution counts. Open source isn’t just about code; it’s about community.

## Where to Find Beginner-Friendly Projects?

Jumping into open source can feel overwhelming at first—especially if you're staring at thousands of unfamiliar projects on GitHub or GitLab. But don’t worry: there are some great websites designed to help beginners like you find the right place to start.

Here are a few go-to platforms where you can find beginner-friendly repositories, especially ones that welcome help with documentation, typos, or simple code fixes:
- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/)
This is one of the best places to start. It includes a step-by-step tutorial on how to contribute, and lists projects that are beginner-friendly. Many of them welcome documentation contributions.
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
A searchable database of projects that need help. You can filter by tags like `documentation`, `good first issue`, or your preferred programming language.
- [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)
This site curates open GitHub issues labeled `good first issue`. These are usually well-scoped tasks with clear instructions—perfect for getting your feet wet.

Once you find a project that interests you—whether it's in ed tech, healthcare, climate data, or even developer tools—spend a few minutes browsing its README. Does the project excite you? Do you understand its purpose? If yes, that’s a great sign.
