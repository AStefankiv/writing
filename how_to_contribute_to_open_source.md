# How to Contribute to Open Source

## What is Open Source? (Definitions, examples with links, why contribute)
Open source refers to software that anyone can view, use, modify, and share. Instead of keeping the code within the company, developers make it public—often hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

You’ve probably used open-source tools without even realizing it! For example:

- Mozilla Firefox – an open-source web browser
- Linux – the operating system behind Android and many servers
- VS Code – a popular code editor

So, why should you contribute?
Besides giving back to the community, contributing to open source is a great way to:

- Build your skills with real-world projects
- Collaborate with developers from around the world
- Strengthen your portfolio and resume
- Learn version control tools like Git in a practical way
- Grow your confidence as a coder and communicator

Whether you're fixing typos, writing documentation, or adding features—every contribution counts. Open source isn’t just about code; it’s about community.
