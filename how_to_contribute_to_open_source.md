# How to Contribute to Open Source

## What is Open Source? (Definitions, examples with links, why contribute)

Open source is source code or documentation that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution(source: Wikipedia)—often hosted on platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). To make it simple - anyone, who believes in collaboration, transparency and innovation, can contribute to open source projects to make a positive impact.

You've probably used open-source tools without even realizing it! For example:
- Mozilla Firefox – an open-source web browser
- Linux – the operating system behind Android and many servers
- VS Code – a popular code editor

Why should you contribute?
Besides leaving your name in the project forever, contributing to open source is a great way to:
- Build your skills with real-world projects
- Collaborate with developers from around the world
- Strengthen your portfolio and resume
- Learn version control tools like Git in a practical way
- Grow your confidence as a coder and communicator

Whether you're fixing typos, writing documentation, or adding features—every contribution counts. Open source isn’t just about code; it’s about community.
